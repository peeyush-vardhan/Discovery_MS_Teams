# Discovery_MS_Teams

**Context:**
Microsoft Teams has become the new way people connect, collaborate, andvaccomplish more with a new class of applications that break down barriers between
business processes and collaboration. Designed to reduce context-switching, the Teams platform has a growing number of collaborative apps. These apps can be
embedded directly into Teams or integrate components of Teams such as meetings or chatâ€”right in the interface of the applications.
